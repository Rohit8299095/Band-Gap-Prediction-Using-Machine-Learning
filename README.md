**2D Material Band Gap Prediction using Machine Learning**
**Overview**
This project focuses on predicting the band gap of 2D materials using machine learning techniques. The objective is to develop a model capable of anticipating the electronic band gaps of semiconductor 2D materials. 
By leveraging a diverse dataset and employing various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, Gradient Boosted Decision Tree, 
Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Convolutional Neural Networks, 
this study aims to revolutionize material design and discovery processes through rapid assessment of electronic properties.

**Dataset**
We have compiled the dataset on our own from Material Project, Computational C2DB Material Database.

**Usage**
1. Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
2. Preprocess the dataset using data_preprocessing.py.
3. Train the desired machine learning models using the scripts provided in the respective directories (random_forest.py, svm_regression.py, gradient_boosted_trees.py, mlp.py, cnn.py).
4. Evaluate model performance and compare results using relevant metrics.
5. Fine-tune hyperparameters as necessary to optimize model performance.
